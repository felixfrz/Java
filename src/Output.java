* Print Text
? You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:
! System.out.println("Hello World!");
? You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will aa new line for each method:
! System.out.println("Hello World!");
! System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
! System.out.println("It is awesome!");

*Double Quotes
? When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:
! System.out.println("This sentence will work!");
! System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);


*The Print() Method
? There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
? The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
! System.out.print("Hello World! ");
! System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
