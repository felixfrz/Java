public class Syntax {
   /* 
   ! Java Syntax
? In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Syntax.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:
*/
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }



/* 
!     Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Syntax. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

* Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

*The main Method
? The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
? Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

? For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.
* System.out.println
? Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

* Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

*System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

*Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.
